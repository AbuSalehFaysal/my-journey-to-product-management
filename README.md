## What is Product Management?  
We all have the basic idea of Product management or the role of product managers which contributes to the Product Cycle from before the development of the product and after the release of the products and constant improvements based on the needs. After seeing tons of videos and reading a gigantic amount of blogs about Product management, I found three core values which define a PM role.  

✅️ Identify the vision of the Product.  

✅️ Create a Roadmap that helps the team to fulfill that vision.  

✅️ Constantly stay in touch with the product end-user and stakeholder to meet their requirements and share with the entire team so the whole team understands what we are doing and why.

## Product vs Project Management  
When I started working in the tech industry back in 2020, I used to think these two roles had a lot of similarities—which is technically true. However, there are key differences:  

**🔹 Product Management:**  
Product development is an ongoing cycle that never truly ends. To survive in a competitive market, products need continuous improvement. A product manager sets the vision and goals for the product, bridges the gap between customers and the company, and collaborates with various internal teams, such as marketing and design. This process is ongoing and ever-evolving.  

**🔹 Project Management:**  
On the other hand, these never-ending product cycles are executed through measurable **projects**. A project manager is responsible for **resource budgeting, task allocation, timelines, and strategies** to accomplish specific goals within a defined timeframe. While product management focuses on the **"what and why,"** project management ensures the **"how and when."**  


## Roles and Responsibilities of a Product Manager  

In simple words, a PM:  

✅️ Defines product vision, roadmaps, and strategies.
 
✅️ Gathers customer requirements and prioritizes them.  

✅️ Works with teams such as sales, marketing, and engineering to fulfill those requirements.  


## Key Skills for a Product Manager  

If I have to shortlist the key skills, I would say a PM at least needs to have basic **technical, business, and UI/UX design** skills. You don't need to be a master of these sectors, but a basic understanding is mandatory.  

On top of these, as key skills, I think a PM needs:  

✅️ **Strategic thinking**  

✅️ **Understanding customer needs and market trends**  

✅️ **Influencing cross-functional teams** (without pushing or forcing)  

## Product Development Lifecycle

Product Managers have to work during the entire lifecycle of the product starting from generating idea to release. The product lifecycle consists five primary stages

✅️ **Ideation**

✅️ **Designing**

✅️ **Development**

✅️ **Testing**

✅️ **Launching**

## Product Development Phase

Product Development is the phase when we officially build the product. However, the phase starts from collecting user requirements to understand the customer's pain points, way before building the product, and it continues even after countless testing just to make the product better for the customers. 


## Introduction Phase of Product Development

Lifecycle The introduction phase starts when a product makes its first step to market from development. PM's primary responsibility in the introduction phase is monitoring the product's performance in the market and gathering feedback from early-stage customers.


## Growth Phase of Product Development

After the Development & Introduction phase, the real challenge begins—scaling the product. This is where a Product Manager must turn insights into action.

✅ Analyze customer feedback – Understand what’s working and what’s not.

✅ Study competitors – Learn from their strengths and weaknesses.

✅ Refine the strategy – Optimize pricing, distribution, and user experience to drive adoption.

✅ Leverage marketing & sales – Position the product for maximum reach and engagement.

The goal? Sustainable growth and market dominance. 🔥

## Maturity Phase of Product Development

After successfully navigating the Development, Introduction, and Growth phases, your product reaches Maturity—a stage of stable revenue and a strong customer base. But the work doesn’t stop here!

✅ Retain loyal customers – Enhance user experience and maintain engagement.

✅ Diversify & innovate – Introduce new features to attract fresh audiences.

✅ Optimize & improve – Stay ahead of the competition with continuous refinements.

A great product doesn’t just survive—it evolves.

## Decline Phase of Product Management

Every product has a lifecycle--Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and ultimately, Decline. The decline phase is inevitable, but what differentiates a product manager is how they navigate it. 

When a product starts losing market traction, PMs face tough strategic decisions: 

✅️ Discontinuation - When maintaining the product is no longer viable. 

✅️ Repositioning - Finding a new market fit or audience. 

✅️ Reinvention - Enhancing the product to meet evolving customer needs.

A declining product isn't always the end-it's an opportunity for transformation. 

## Product Identification

Product Identification is the crucial factor for the pm to identify products, including product core features, value proposition and target users.

## Brainstorming Techniques for Product Identification


Brainstorming Techniques like Mind Map, SCAMPER, and SWOT Analysis help PM to identify the product, explore features, align the product with the vision and overall product strategy. 

## Mind Mapping

As a Product Manager, you juggle multiple aspects of a product—features, user needs, stakeholder expectations, project timelines, market trends, and much more. With so many moving pieces, how do you ensure clarity and alignment?

For me, mind mapping is a game-changer. 🖊️💡

✅ It helps visualize connections between different product elements.

✅ It breaks down complex ideas into structured, actionable insights.

✅ It fosters collaboration, making stakeholder communication more effective.

Whether it’s prioritizing features, planning a roadmap, or aligning teams, a well-structured mind map ensures that I never lose sight of the bigger picture.

## Brainwriting in Product Management


Brainwriting is a structured brainstorming in Product Management where every member individually writes down their idea and shares it with others for development. 

## SCAMPER

SCAMPER represents Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify/Magnify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse. In simple words, it's a tool for the pm to analyze the current product, identify areas of improvement, and discover new features or entirely new products, ensuring competitive advantage and long-term success. 


## Iterative Process in Product Management

Generally, the Iterative process means repetition. In product management, pm uses this process to continuously improve their products, which roughly includes creating, testing, refining and repeating. 

## Product Discovery

In short product discovery means deciding what to build. However, it also asks you a few questions. 

1. Are we meeting stakeholders needs?
2. Can customers use our product?
2. Do the customers want our product?
4. Do the customers care about the problem we are solving?


## Selection in Product Management

Selection involves identifying which features and projects to prioritize based on business goals, customer needs, and user feedback. As a product manager (PM), effective product selection is crucial for ensuring the product's success in the market. PMs utilize tools such as product roadmaps, prioritization metrics, and user feedback to guide their decisions on selection.

## Validation

Validation in Product Management refers to a step that ensures product is meeting the customers needs. We have to do this before the development of the product to avoid mistakes. 

## Execution

Execution in Product Management refers to implementation of the plans. It involves resource management, working with different teams, budgeting and make sure the product is aligned with the business needs. 

## Blue Ocean Strategy

Back in 2005, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne came up with something pretty game-changing—a concept called Blue Ocean Strategy. Instead of fighting for space in crowded markets (what they call the Red Ocean), this strategy is all about creating a new market where there’s no competition yet. It’s a mindset a lot of modern product managers still live by.

Take Slack, for example. Email was always there for workplace communication, but Slack came in and made things so much easier—pinning messages, reacting with emojis, replying in threads. It just clicked. Once you use it, it’s hard to imagine going back. And it feels like slack is just a beautiful creation that you always needed in your work life.

If I think about a local example in Bangladesh, Bikroy.com pops into my head. When they launched, the idea of a digital marketplace wasn’t really a thing here. But they created that space—and suddenly, buying and selling online became normal.

These are both awesome examples of how powerful it can be when you stop trying to beat the competition—and just build something new instead.

## TRIZ in Product Management

TRIZ stands for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving. It's a tool that helps PM to discover solution, accelerate product development, solve complex problem and predict future business trends. 

## Problem Framing

Problem Framing sounds like a fancy term but what it really means for pm is to articulate a problem in a detailed way, understanding the root cause of the problem. Most of the time, an efficient product solution depends how deeply we understand the problem. 

## Market Analysis
Market Analysis is an essential responsibility of a Product Manager. It involves a deep understanding of potential customers, competitors, and prevailing business trends. This knowledge empowers PMs to craft effective strategies for successful product development.

## Identifying Market Needs under Market Analysis

Understanding market needs is crucial when analyzing a market. It’s not just about what you’re selling, but why customers are interested in it. A Product Manager's goal is to uncover unmet problems — issues that haven't been solved yet, but customers are willing to pay for a solution. This is where innovation happens: by identifying gaps in the market and finding ways to fill them. It’s all about truly understanding the customer and their needs, then delivering something that makes a real impact
