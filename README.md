## What is Product Management?
We all have the basic idea of Product management or the role of product managers which contributes to the Product Cycle from before the development of the product and after the release of the products and constant improvements based on the needs. After seeing tons of videos and reading a gigantic amount of blogs about Product management, I found three core values which define a PM role.

✅️ Identify the vision of the Product.

✅️ Create a Roadmap that helps the team to fulfill that vision.

✅️ Constantly stay in touch with the product end-user and stakeholder to meet their requirements and share with the entire team so the whole team understands what we are doing and why.
