## What is Product Management?  
We all have the basic idea of Product management or the role of product managers which contributes to the Product Cycle from before the development of the product and after the release of the products and constant improvements based on the needs. After seeing tons of videos and reading a gigantic amount of blogs about Product management, I found three core values which define a PM role.  

✅️ Identify the vision of the Product.  

✅️ Create a Roadmap that helps the team to fulfill that vision.  

✅️ Constantly stay in touch with the product end-user and stakeholder to meet their requirements and share with the entire team so the whole team understands what we are doing and why.

## Product vs Project Management  
When I started working in the tech industry back in 2020, I used to think these two roles had a lot of similarities—which is technically true. However, there are key differences:  

**🔹 Product Management:**  
Product development is an ongoing cycle that never truly ends. To survive in a competitive market, products need continuous improvement. A product manager sets the vision and goals for the product, bridges the gap between customers and the company, and collaborates with various internal teams, such as marketing and design. This process is ongoing and ever-evolving.  

**🔹 Project Management:**  
On the other hand, these never-ending product cycles are executed through measurable **projects**. A project manager is responsible for **resource budgeting, task allocation, timelines, and strategies** to accomplish specific goals within a defined timeframe. While product management focuses on the **"what and why,"** project management ensures the **"how and when."**

## Roles and Responsibilities of a Product Manager  

In simple words, a PM:  

✅️ Defines product vision, roadmaps, and strategies.  
✅️ Gathers customer requirements and prioritizes them.  
✅️ Works with teams such as sales, marketing, and engineering to fulfill those requirements.

## Key Skills for a Product Manager  

If I have to shortlist the key skills, I would say a PM at least needs to have basic **technical, business, and UI/UX design** skills. You don't need to be a master of these sectors, but a basic understanding is mandatory.  

On top of these, as key skills, I think a PM needs:  

✅️ **Strategic thinking**  

✅️ **Understanding customer needs and market trends**  

✅️ **Influencing cross-functional teams** (without pushing or forcing)  

## Product Development Lifecycle

Product Managers have to work during the entire lifecycle of the product starting from generating idea to release. The product lifecycle consists five primary stages

✅️ **Ideation**

✅️ **Designing**

✅️ **Development**

✅️ **Testing**

✅️ **Launching**

## Product Development Phase

Product Development is the phase when we officially build the product. However, the phase starts from collecting user requirements to understand the customer's pain points, way before building the product, and it continues even after countless testing just to make the product better for the customers. 


## Introduction Phase of Product Development

Lifecycle The introduction phase starts when a product makes its first step to market from development. PM's primary responsibility in the introduction phase is monitoring the product's performance in the market and gathering feedback from early-stage customers.


## The Growth Phase of Product Development

After the Development & Introduction phase, the real challenge begins—scaling the product. This is where a Product Manager must turn insights into action.

✅ Analyze customer feedback – Understand what’s working and what’s not.
✅ Study competitors – Learn from their strengths and weaknesses.
✅ Refine the strategy – Optimize pricing, distribution, and user experience to drive adoption.
✅ Leverage marketing & sales – Position the product for maximum reach and engagement.

The goal? Sustainable growth and market dominance. 🔥
